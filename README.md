## App description
Interview Advanced helps job seekers prepare for, and ace their next interview(s). Enter a job role (and job description if available), and Gemini generates tailored interview questions. When you record your answers, they are evaluated using Google AI and Gemini. It then scores your response against our scoring rubric. The scores are used to provide you with detailed feedback, charts, metrics, and data visualizations.

Gemini API is being used to: 1. Generate tailored interview questions for the user; 2. Evaluating the user's response to the interview question; 3. Allowing the user to view a sample answer for their interview question, in case they are unsure of how to answer the question; 4. Evaluating their sample answer; 5. Generating an enhanced answer when the interview is done and the user is reviewing their feedback.

Google AI is being used to: 1. Handle Text-to-speech (TTS) so that users can hear the interview question being read out loud; 2. Handle Speech-to-text (STT) so that users can answer interview questions verbally and have their answers transcribed into text so that it can be evaluated.
