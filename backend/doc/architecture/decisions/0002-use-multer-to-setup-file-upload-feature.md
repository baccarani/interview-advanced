Date: 2024-01-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Managing file uploads in Express.js web applications poses challenges, including parsing data from HTML forms, enforcing size limits, validating file types for security, handling multiple uploads in a single request, and customizing destination directories and file names. The integration of these functionalities into the application flow requires a solution that is efficient, secure, and seamlessly integrates with Express middleware.

This problem statement highlights the need for a specialized tool like Multer, which addresses these challenges, streamlining the file upload process and providing a clean API for developers to manage user-generated content effectively while ensuring security, scalability, and ease of integration within Express applications.

## Decision

We are proposing Multer for handling file uploads in our Express.js web application due to its seamless integration as middleware, comprehensive features addressing challenges like size limits and file type validation, and its ability to streamline the file upload process with a clean API, ensuring efficient and secure management of user-generated content.

## Consequences

### Here are the key problems that Multer addresses

- #### Formidable File Uploads:

  Multer addresses the challenge of processing file uploads from HTML forms. When users submit forms that include file input fields, Multer helps parse and handle the file data efficiently.

- #### File Size Limitations:

  Multer allows you to set limits on the size of uploaded files. This helps prevent abuse or unintentional issues related to users attempting to upload excessively large files that could negatively impact server resources or network bandwidth.

- #### File Type Validation:

  Multer provides functionality to validate the file types of uploaded files. You can specify acceptable file extensions or MIME types, helping to enhance the security of your application by preventing the upload of potentially harmful files.

- #### Multiple File Uploads:

  Multer simplifies the process of handling multiple files uploaded in a single request. It can process and organize multiple files, making it easier for developers to manage and store the uploaded content.

- #### Destination and File Naming:

  Multer allows you to define the destination directory where uploaded files should be stored. It also provides options for customizing the naming conventions of uploaded files, giving developers control over how files are organized and named on the server.

- #### Integration with Express:

  Multer is specifically designed as middleware for Express, making it seamlessly integrate into Express applications. It becomes part of the middleware stack and can be easily added to specific routes that handle file uploads.

- #### Callback Handling:
  Multer simplifies the handling of file upload callbacks. It provides a clean API for dealing with the uploaded files, such as accessing file information, managing errors, and executing custom logic after a file has been successfully uploaded.
