Date: 2024-02-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the digital age, ensuring secure access to web and mobile applications is paramount for businesses and organizations. However, implementing robust authentication and authorization systems can be complex, time-consuming, and prone to security vulnerabilities if not done properly. Many organizations struggle with managing user identities securely across multiple applications, platforms, and devices while also providing a seamless user experience.

## Decision

To address these challenges, implementing Auth0, a leading identity management platform, can streamline the authentication and authorization process for web and mobile applications. Auth0 offers comprehensive features such as single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), user management, role-based access control (RBAC), and social login integrations. By leveraging Auth0, organizations can offload the burden of building and maintaining authentication systems, thus freeing up resources to focus on core business activities. Additionally, Auth0 provides robust security measures, compliance certifications, and scalability to meet the evolving needs of businesses across various industries.
