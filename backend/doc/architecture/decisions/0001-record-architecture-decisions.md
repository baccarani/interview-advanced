# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-01-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

Start to record all new architecture decisions and when necessary do a retroactive work to guarantee the knowledge base of this project.
